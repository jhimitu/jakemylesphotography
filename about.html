            <p>
                Hi! I'm Jake, and I'm a Denver-based photographer & videographer. 
                I was born in California and a couple months into my life me 
                and my family moved to Aurora, Colorado where I was raised.
                Around my senior year of high school, I started to get into cameras. After spending 
                lots of time watching YouTubers on YouTube; I decided I wanted to be a YouTuber. 
                I continued to pursue my career as a YouTuber even after high school. As time went on, 
                my brother and I decided to start a production company and I started to get a little 
                more serious about cameras. I enrolled at the Art Institute in Denver, where I focused 
                on photography. After finishing my first quarter at the Art Institute I decided to leave and do 
                photography full time. Since going full time, I've been completely focused on building my photography business.
                It's a great feeling to be doing what I love. I hope you like what I create.
